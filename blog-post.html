                    Grilled salmon is one of the most beloved dishes at Amaala's Delight, and for good reason. When prepared correctly, it's flaky, flavorful, and incredibly healthy. Today, I'm sharing the secrets that make our grilled salmon so popular with our guests.
                </p>

                <h2>Choosing the Right Salmon</h2>
                <p>
                    The foundation of a great grilled salmon dish starts with selecting high-quality fish. Look for salmon that has a bright, vibrant color and smells fresh like the ocean, not fishy. Wild-caught salmon typically has a richer flavor and firmer texture, while farm-raised salmon tends to be fattier and more buttery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Amaala's Delight, we prefer using fresh Atlantic or King salmon for grilling. The thicker cuts hold up better on the grill and provide that perfect balance of crispy exterior and moist interior.
                </p>

                <h2>Essential Ingredients</h2>
                <p>For this recipe, you'll need:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 salmon fillets (6 oz each), skin on</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
                    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon fresh dill, chopped</li>
                    <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
                    <li>Lemon wedges for serving</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>

                <h3>1. Prepare the Marinade</h3>
                <p>
                    In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, and chopped dill. This simple marinade enhances the salmon's natural flavors without overpowering them. Season generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Marinate the Salmon</h3>
                <p>
                    Place the salmon fillets in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over them. Make sure each fillet is well-coated. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Don't marinate for too long as the acid in the lemon juice can start to "cook" the fish and affect its texture.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Prepare Your Grill</h3>
                <p>
                    Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (around 375-400°F). Clean the grates thoroughly and oil them lightly to prevent sticking. This is crucial for achieving those beautiful grill marks and ensuring the fish releases easily.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Grill the Salmon</h3>
                <p>
                    Remove the salmon from the marinade and let any excess drip off. Place the fillets skin-side down on the grill. Close the lid and cook for 6-8 minutes without moving them. This allows the skin to crisp up and acts as a protective barrier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After 6-8 minutes, carefully flip the salmon using a wide spatula. The skin should release easily if it's ready. Cook for another 3-4 minutes on the flesh side until the salmon reaches an internal temperature of 145°F and flakes easily with a fork.
                </p>

                <h2>Pro Tips from Our Kitchen</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Don't overcook:</strong> Salmon continues cooking after you remove it from heat. Take it off the grill when it's slightly underdone in the center.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use a fish spatula:</strong> A wide, flexible spatula makes flipping salmon much easier and prevents it from breaking apart.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check for doneness:</strong> The salmon should be opaque and flake easily, but still be moist in the center.</li>
                    <li><strong>Let it rest:</strong> Allow the salmon to rest for 2-3 minutes before serving to let the juices redistribute.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
                <p>
                    At Amaala's Delight, we serve our grilled salmon with roasted vegetables, a fresh garden salad, or creamy mashed potatoes. A squeeze of fresh lemon juice right before serving brightens all the flavors. You can also garnish with extra fresh dill and a drizzle of high-quality olive oil.
                </p>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                    Mastering grilled salmon takes practice, but once you get the technique down, it becomes one of the easiest and most impressive dishes you can make. The key is to start with quality ingredients, don't overthink the seasoning, and watch your cooking time carefully.
                </p>
